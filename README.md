## Feature Analysis and Evaluating Machine Learning Models with Yellowbrick

The goal of this project is to perform feature analysis and evaluate machine learning models with [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/). In other words, we are going to use visualizations to steer our machine learning workflow.  

We want to predict whether rooms in apartments are occupied or unoccupied based on passive sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light and CO2 levels.  

On the feature analysis part, the project covers the following: scatter plots, RadViz, parallel coordinates plots, feature ranking, and manifold visualization.

Next, we build a logistic regression model for binary classification. ROC/AUC plots, confusion matrices, cross-validation scores are the steps used to evaluate the model.
